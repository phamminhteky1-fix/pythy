# 🧠 Pythy Assistant

**Pythy** is a (modular features comming soon), command-line, part Narrow AI, part Gemini chat CLI assistant built in Python. It combines casual conversation, games, Wikipedia summaries, and Gemini-powered AI chat — all wrapped in a clean, Python code.

## 📦 Features

- 💬 **Casual Chat**: 10 conversation templates that I have made + random mode
- 🎯 **Guessing Game**: An simple guessing game that I made
- 📚 **Wikipedia Summaries**: Quick info lookup on any topic
- 🌐 **Web Launching**: Open any web browser page. I got Youtube and Google predefined
- 🤖 **Gemini AI Chat**: Uses Google’s Gemini models with automatic failover
- 🧹 **Temporary Package Management**: Installs missing packages at runtime and removes them when done (I have to add this "useless" feature to save my storage)
- 
## ❓  How to use:
1. Clone my rep (DO NOT FORK!!!)
2. Go to Google AI studio and create an AI API key.
3. touch .env and add an element: GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
4. Run the main.py code thingy

## Why you should never fork this repo
I have seen very many outdated forks from everywhere at random Github profiles and repos. So, please clone, do not fork so you can always be updated. Each time I realease a new version of Pythy you can you git pull in ease.
